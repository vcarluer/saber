* Why so much hate and anger?  
No need of an adress bar, url or part of it can be directly entered in google search  
No need of tabs, you have maximum only two eyes  
No need of bookmarks, internet is alive, search again with google  
No need of storage access, services are online now  
No need of plugin, Html5 in da place  
No need of localisation, you can enter it in exchange of some privacy, performance and a zero parameter browser  
No need of forward button, click again on that hyperlink if you are not a red fish  
No need of parameters, just browse  
  
* Why anonymous?  
Because by default browsing must be anonymous.  
And because there are no parameters to go another way than the default one.  
It is as much anonymous than incognito mode in Chrome, so in fact it is not really.  
  
* An enhancement, a bug, a new feature?  
Send me an email for bug or standard html badly handled.  
No new features in this product.
